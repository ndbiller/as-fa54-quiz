## Git Workflow

Clone the project locally...  

```
git clone <url.git>
```

...or pull the master when new changes of a contributor have been merged to it. Make sure you are in your local master branch.  

```
git checkout master
git pull origin HEAD
```

Then check out a new working branch.  

```
git checkout -b <branchname>
```

Make your changes. Then add your changes to the working branch.  

```
git add --all
```

Now commit the changes and give a short description of what you have done in the message.  

```
git commit -m "<message>"
```

Then push the commit of your working branch to the project repository.  

```
git push origin HEAD
```

The code will be reviewed by us regularly and if all is well and the tests were green the working branches will be merged into the master.  
Rinse and repeat.  

## Git Cleanup

You can view all your local branches with:  

```
git branch
```

If you pull the recent master after your working branch has been merged, you can show merged local branches with:  

```
git branch --merged
```

And then you can delete merged local branches with:  

```
git branch -d <branchname>
```

If a working branch is obsolete but not merged with the master you can force-delete it with:  

```
git branch -D <branchname>
```
